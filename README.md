Project
New Wave of Gachon, the AI Engineering Building

Team
Team name: Metagachon Gazagung(메타가천 가자궁)

Team members: Jaewon Kim, Gayoung Lee, Dongsub Lee, Yeoni Yoo, Sehyun Yun

Background of the Project
Our team comprises students majoring or double-majoring in software. We take all our major classes in the AI Engineering Building and spend most of our time on campus there.

We define this AI Engineering Building, where we spend our time, as our team's unique identity. However, unless you're a student of the IT Convergence College, you don't often visit the AI Engineering Building. Thus, we've embarked on this project to introduce the newly built AI Engineering Building and its surroundings to all Gachon University students through Metaverse.

Our model is set in spring because many students saw cherry blossoms on campus for the first time this year. Seeing the cherry blossoms made us feel like the campus was returning to its pre-pandemic vitality, making this spring particularly memorable. Hence, we chose to recreate this in our Metaverse project.

Summary
Our Metaverse project recreates several locations in Gachon University, including the AI Engineering Building, the sports field, and the dormitories.

Upon first connecting, you start at the Gachon shuttle bus stop. Following the road, you'll find a fork leading to the AI Engineering Building on a downhill path and another leading to the sports field. Following the path to the Engineering Building, you'll find a large parking lot and an open plaza with stairs where students can relax freely. Next to these is the symbol of our map, the AI Engineering Building.

Next, if you follow the path to the sports field, you will see the dormitory, the rooftop of the Engineering Building connected to the sports field, and the lively sports field. We also added various characters and tools needed for sports such as soccer balls and basketballs to vividly depict the lively atmosphere of the students.

Our project has devoted considerable effort not only to the buildings but also to the roads and surrounding scenery. We have implemented various means of transportation found in the actual school, such as the shuttle bus, cars, bicycles, and scooters. We have also detailed the landscaping that can be seen within the school, such as trees, flowers, flower beds, and shrubs.
